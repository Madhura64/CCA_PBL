Load Balancing

A load balancer is a critical component in system design, distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to improve performance, reliability, and availability. Acting as a "traffic cop," it ensures no single server is overwhelmed, optimizing resource utilization and maintaining high availability. 

Load balancers are essential in cloud computing, data centers, and large-scale web applications where efficient traffic management is key. They can be hardware-based, requiring dedicated devices, or software-based, operating on servers, virtual machines, or in the cloud. When a user request arrives, the load balancer assigns it to an appropriate server, balancing the workload efficiently.

This process is guided by algorithms, which are categorized as static or dynamic, based on factors like server load or pre-defined rules. Many content delivery networks also integrate load balancing to enhance their capabilities.
